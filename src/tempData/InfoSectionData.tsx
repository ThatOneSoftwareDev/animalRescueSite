        "In 2016, I (Ryan Phillips) got a message in the middle of the night asking if I would be willing to adopt a former breeder pig named Pumpkin that had just had her last round of babies.  We were told that if we didn’t take her she was unlikely to have a happy ending.  The problem was, my family lived in a 2-bedroom condo on the second floor up a flight of winding stairs in the City of Williamsburg where the laws related to minipigs are such that I wasn’t sure if mini pigs would be welcomed.  Of course, not taking this pig meant she could end up without a home or worse.  And soon after we decided to ask to bring one of Pumpkin’s babies, Charlotte, with her (since we wished she never had to be separated from any of her children).  And then came Millie, a piglet that was being booted from her home and needed a place quickly.  She was followed by Tesla the rabbit and then Beatrice the escaped farm hen.  It was the arrival of Beatrice the chicken that made us realize living in a second story condo was probably not a good fit for what had become nothing less than a condo micro sanctuary.  And it was at the time we learned of a piece of agricultural land going on sale nearby.  Knowing there was a fenced in open yard ready for us, we knew we had found our home almost without needing to see the house."

        "What is ‘Life with Pigs’ and ‘Life with Pigs Farm Animal Sanctuary’?         ",
        "Life with Pigs is a 501c3 nonprofit dedicated to educating people about the injustices faced by animals and how we can better coexist with our fellow earthlings.  We operate under the guiding principle that animals are our equals and deserve equal consideration for their needs and desires. Much of our outreach involves bringing people into contact with animals often seen as ‘food animals’ and helping them to realize that these animals deserve the right to live happily just as much as dogs and cats do.  We met and impacted thousands of people by simply taking our pigs and eventually our chicken out to places like Colonial Williamsburg and college campuses.  While the pigs and chicken grazed on grass, many people came to meet them and were changed forever.  We had so many people tell us in the moment that they would never see these animals the same again.  Many pledged to no longer participate in the abuses happening to these animals by going vegan."

        "Our sanctuary is special because every animal given a forever home will be a known individual and integral member of the sanctuary family.  We will never grow so large that animals will be anything less than an adored and loved family member.  The physical land size of our sanctuary makes it impossible to grow too large and our goal is that every individual living with us will be a known personality whose story will help transform the world’s understanding of the animals we so commonly take for granted as mere commodities.
